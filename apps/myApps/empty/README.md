ofTessellationTest
==================


Test the tessellation stage with openFrameworks. 

The basic tessellation functionality is working, but still problems with the shaders. 

Evaluation shader doesn't like to access other variables than Color in the interface block declartion. 

Tested on OSX 10.9.
